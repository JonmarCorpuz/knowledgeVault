# API Group Overview

* All Kubernetes APIs are grouped in API groups
* Each resource within an API group has actions associated with them
* You can view the available API groups using the `curl http://localhost:6443 -k --key admin.key --cert admin.crt --cacert ca.crt` command when connected to your cluster (`curl http://localhost:6443/API_GROUP` to list all the supported resource groups within an API group)
