# Build Overview

A build is the automated process (series of tasks) that transforms source code into deployable software artifact

* Involves compiling the code, linking dependencies, packaging binaries, running automated tests, and creating build outputs (*executables*, *libraries*, *containers*)
* Enables early detection of issues by ensuring that code changes can successfully integrate and function together
