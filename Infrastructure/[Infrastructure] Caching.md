# Caching Overview

Caching is a performance technique where a system keeps a temporary and fast-access copy of data so it doesn't need to retrieve or recompute that data every time in order to provide lower latency in excahnge for more resource usage

* The cached copy usually lives in faster but smaller storage (ex: *RAM*, *CPU*, *Edge CDN node*, *etc.*) 
* A cached copy represents a subset of the full data set
