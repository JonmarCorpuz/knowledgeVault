# Directed Acyclic Graphs Overview

DAGs are directed graphs that consist only of vertices that are connected by edges that have a specific direction

* Data cannot travel along the edges in a way that loops back to the same vertex in order to ensure that there are no closed loops 
* Graphs only move in one direction without repetition
