# DAG Edges Overview

An edge is the connection between vertices that have a specific direction from one vertex to another

* Each edge represents a one-way relationship or dependency
* The direction of edges allows DAGs to represent hierarchies, sequences, or causal chains where some nodes depend on or lead to others
