# Public Key Infrastructure Overview

PKI is a framework that's used to create, manage, distribute, and revoke digital certificates and the public-private keys behind them

* Allows users, devices, and services to securely prove their identity and protect data over untrusted networks
* Associates a public key with an identity via a digitally signed certificate so others can trust that key really belongs to that identity
