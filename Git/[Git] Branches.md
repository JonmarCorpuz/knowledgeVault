# Git Branches Overview

A branch in Git is a parallel workspace that's isolated from the main branch

* Allows developers to test new features and bug fixes without affected the main codebase
* The work in a branch can then be merged back into the main branch to integrate the changes
* Makes it easier to manage different tasks simultaneously
