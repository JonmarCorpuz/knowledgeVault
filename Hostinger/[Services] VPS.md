# Virtual Private Server Overview

A VPS is a VM that users rent from a hosting provider that behaves like their own dedicated server

* Created by a hypervisor that slices a physical server into multiple independent virtual servers that each has its own OS and configurations
* Users are guaranteed allocations of vCPU, RAM, disk, and bandwidth so that other tenant's workloads shouldn't directly impact other users' reserved resources
